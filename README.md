## General info

The [shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell) is a program that takes commands from the keyboard and gives them to the operating system to perform. In the old days, it was the only user interface available on a Unix-like system such as Linux. Nowadays, we have graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in addition to commandline interfaces (CLIs) such as the shell. On most Linux systems a program called [bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) (which stands for Bourne Again SHell, an enhanced version of the original Unix shell program, sh, written by Steve Bourne) acts as the shell program.

## Technologies

Holberton school asks us to work with a specific version of some programms. That is, because they use a code checker on the intranet that works with these versions: 

 - Linux, vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64 3.13.0-170-generic #220-Ubuntu SMP.
 - GNU Emacs 24.3.1.
 - GNU bash, version 4.3.11(1)-release (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)
 - Git version 1.9.1.
 - [Github](https://github.com/)
